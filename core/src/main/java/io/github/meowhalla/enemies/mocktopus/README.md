# Mocktopus
Boss that mocks the player behaviour - attacks only when player is attacking and uses the same weapon
(but with stronger stats). When player is not attacking for some time, Mocktopus will start 
chasing them - when touched, it starts an energy transfer (boss will heal itself and player will lose health).
